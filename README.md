# Sentence Similarity
Sentence SImilarity can be used for many domains in natural language processing, including information retrieval, translation memories, question answering etc. There are many methods to calculate the similarity between two strings. In this project I have evaluated those methods using SICK and STS data sets. Traditional approaches can be found in Traditional Sentence Similarity.ipynb and the approaches based on embeddings can be found in Sentence Similarity.ipynb .
