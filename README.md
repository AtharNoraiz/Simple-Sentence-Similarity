# Sentence Similarity
Word embeddings have become widespread in Natural Language Processing. They allow us to easily compute the semantic similarity between two words, or to find the words most similar to a target word. However, in many applications we're more interested in the similarity between two sentences or short texts. There are many ways to compare similarities of 2 texts using traditional methods like edit distance as well as using deep learning neural networks. In this project, I compare some simple ways of computing sentence similarity.
